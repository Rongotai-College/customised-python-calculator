### The conversion process

Converting *.py to *.exe

pip install pyinstaller
–	Navigate to the directory where your python file is
–	It should preferably be placed in a directory on its own

Desktop\pyapp>pyinstaller —onefile –w –i icon.ico calc.py

–	Create an *.ico file from a *.png.  Select an image of less than 60kb
–	Convertico.com is an excellent site for this


After exe has been created, the executable will be in the ‘dist’ folder
You can delete the rest of the folders that were generated by the conversion process.

** Please note that this process requires:
    python to be installed on your computer
    You need to have administrator rights to the computer
    Pip – package manager for Python
    Pyinstaller is the Python utility that will run the conversion process.**
